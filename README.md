<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![The Home Page](https://github.com/IndiOfEarth/starfish-and-coffee/blob/master/images/Home%20Page.jpg?raw=true)

Starfish and Coffee is a simple demonstration of using RESTful routing in a website. All the information about the cafes comes from a database file
and each cafe (and thus its entry in the database) can be viewed, edited and deleted from the website. In a real working website, the ability to edit
and delete a cafe would be locked behind a login system. I plan on adding this in the future.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Future Updates

I don't update this project often, but I like to tinker around with projects. This is mainly for my benefit, as I like
to try out new things as I continue to discover/learn.


### Pipeline/Future Updates

1. Add a login/profile system to stop unwanted edits
2. Be able to add new Cafes once logged in
3. Having a profile page where you can build up favourite cafes, comments and likes.
